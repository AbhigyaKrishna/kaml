* Switch to multiplatform project layout once this supports recent versions of Gradle
* Kotlin/Native support
* Better error location information when aliases are involved
  * Currently report the location of where the alias was defined, not where it was used
  * Would be good to show the chain through the object hierarchy and aliases
