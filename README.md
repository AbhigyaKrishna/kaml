## What is this?

This library adds YAML support to [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/).

YAML version 1.2 is supported.

This is a very rough initial version:

* Currently, only parsing YAML is supported. Emitting YAML will be added in a future version.
* Many operations are not yet optimised for performance.
